# Head Case

I speak in riddles and half-guessed insinuations,  
parsing out answers to questions I wonâ€™t ask.  
You remain oblivious to this interrogation.

Behind my eyes, a disgraced FBI agent connects  
thumbtacks with red string and desperation.  
You meet my eyes and I question everything.

My face, casual as a crime lab parking lot,  
hides my analytic forensic frenzy behind  
a bland public servant facade.

I gather you like evidence, bag and tag  
every gesture, every word. The boys  
in the lab are gonna love this.
