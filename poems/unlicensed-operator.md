## Unlicensed Operator

I said, "Jesus, take the wheel,"  
but Jesus is in the passenger seat  
scrolling His Instagram feed.  

So I'm here tonight to ask if  
anyone knows a good driving instructor,  
'cause that cliff is getting closer  

and I really need to turn  
this engine over. Highway hypnosis  
has driven me way off course  

but now it's time to focus  
on the forces that brought us here,  
that hold us helpless,  

staring into the stratosphere.  
So, Jesus, take the fucking wheel  
and hold on tight:  

Shit's about to get real, tonight.
