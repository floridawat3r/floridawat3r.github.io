# a hermit goes to the DMV

the dee-emm-vee  
that great equalizer under caesar:  
the meeting place of People and State,  
where the right hand firmly grips the left.  
all must submit, both patience and paperwork,    
. . . stamped, signed-- no, the blue form, please.

somehow this shared misery is a comfort,  
and in this kaleidoscope cross-section of citizenry  
my out-of-place-ness makes sense,  
my imperfect immersion in this world  
muffled by four or five languages  
. . . all spoken at once.

in a room without a dominant paradigm,  
social apes that we are, we maneuver  
together, ships docking among the stars.
