title: a hermit goes shopping
---

i stop in front of the window
of some boutique inside
a shopping mall off the highway.

the clothing on the mannequin
seems to suggest myself to me,
as though i need only try on

this jacket, that skirt--
as if i need only this scarf
to be reborn.

but scarves are only scarves,
and sun-soaked models laugh
in pictures as i turn away.
