title: sunset on a deserted island
---

the waves lay insistent siege
to the shoreline, each wave
a wish long washed away. 

the sun sinks in a wanton display, 
riotous color for no one's sake, flaunting
itself to itself. 

time pauses to take it in, stretching
the moment into a piercing note
of beauty, held impossibly long.

evening comes to shoo the sun away. 
she huffs and shakes out her boundless cloak
as the frogs begin to sing.
