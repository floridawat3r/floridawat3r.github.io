I had such good intentions, of course. One always does when one begins a livejournal-like project like this, and it always devolves into apologies for the delays, etc etc. But we soldier on, because frankly, the summer has been too interesting to not tell all about it.

### June

Grandy passed on June 3rd, 2023. She was in hospice for a week and a half, roughly, and passed exactly how she'd requested, at the age of one hundred and three. My primary emotions have been gratitude that we made it to the finish line without anything horrible happening, without any last-minute miseries.

I had initially planned to take over living in her trailer, but it was even further from work and my family didn't really want to hold on to the property or deal with it, so I started looking around for a new place to live that would actually be near my job. My lease wouldn't be up until September, so I had plenty of time to peep around and see what the market was like. The very first place I found was a) bigger than my old place, b) centrally-located in the party neighborhood, and c) spot on for my budget, so naturally I had to jump on it immediately.

My old apartment complex let me out of my lease without much issue, and I got the keys four days early, so all of a sudden this timer starts on my summer. I now have technically until the en       d of July to get everything out of my old apartment, but every day early that I can get out will be more money they hand me back when my lease ends, so I'm incentivized to move quickly.

To complicate the game, I also have my bio-dad's memorial gathering in New York in mid-July, and a 50/50 shot at going to a festival in Canada at the beginning of August (passport complications), AND having secured the fucking coolest spot in my neighborhood, I decided to set a hard date of August 26th for my housewarming party.

The clock starts June 26th. Every moment not spent preparing for or engaging in one of these social events needs to be spent packing, moving, cleaning, sleeping, or working. The final challenge is solo-hosting a housewarming party wherein I invite people without regard for separation of social spheres and we see how well they gel.

### July

In a swoop of fortune, the theatre is traditionally closed for the first week of July, so I was poised and ready to spend that entire week packing and moving. With only a few days between the theatre reopening and my leaving for New York on the 12th, I set the goal that I would be out of the apartment by the 11th, and (spoilers!) I pulled it off! My mom came down to help, and many friends offered their services to get me out in time. Without the network of people around me, I don't think I would have managed it. There was more heavy lifting than I wanted there to be, and so many pieces of art and furniture donated to the new apartment by friends with overstuffed garages and recently-deceased grandparents.

The trip to New York went better than expected-- coming back to the house in Westchester for the first time since my partner's other partner (ahh, polyamory) has moved into the house and filled it with her stuff. There were some big "I'm being replaced" feelings that we unpacked on the drive there, but overall things have improved drastically having another person in the house.

The memorial service turned out to be a proper Catholic mass that mentioned Jack once, then a buffet at a hotel, and then an afterparty at his house. I didn't recognize anyone, but multiple people recognized me, beard and all! I got to properly meet a whole bunch of family members I'd never known, all of whom were incredibly sweet and filled in a lot of blanks about why I am the way I am. They're the kind of people to have an afterparty after the afterparty, and I would've gone with them if my partner hadn't needed to get back for work.

Once I came back, it was finally time for me to try and get an emergency appointment at the passport office in order to try and get to my pagan festival in Canada-- backstory: I forgot that 2023 was a year that would eventually arrive and when it did I forgot to renew in time. Hilarious! I was able to get an appointment in Atlanta on July 31st, so essentially I would drive there, get my passport, and then drive to Maryland and then Canada.

Getting the passport was a comedy of errors that had me hanging around Atlanta for most of the day waiting to pick it up, but I was able to spend that time hanging out with my uncle who couldn't make it to New York for the service. He's probably the squirreliest human being I've ever met, but also was one of the few to make it out of the AIDS epidemic alive, so he's also a goddamn treasure at this point.

### August

I could easily write an entire entry on the intricacies of Kaleidoscope Gathering-- a thirty-plus-year-old pagan festival held at a pagan campground in Ontario-- the internal politics and community rituals, the way it's the only place outside of Florida that has ever felt like Home, on and on and on, but I will leave that for its own post one day and simply say that there's a small enclave of wonderful people in Ottawa that I am, of course, now pining for. I spent a week and a half hanging out with a beautiful snake witch vampire lady and we are both utterly smitten. We've been texting every day since I left.

I came home fully revitalized, my will to live renewed, and I threw that energy into finishing the unpacking and getting my house ready for the housewarming party. I bought far too much food and champagne, invited people haphazardly, and in general did very little overt planning. People came anyways, everyone was very gracious and said many nice things about my new place, and even made friends with other people they didn't know! I started the party at 3pm with mimosas for those who didn't want to stay late, but I also had plans for charcuterie and then midnight grilled cheese. We never got into the grilled cheeses, there were so many other cheese-and-meats available. I kicked the final guests out at 2am when I truly could not do it any longer.

Overall, the summer was a huge success! I feel like I hit every one of my beats, made it to all the important deadlines and didn't drop any balls that couldn't bounce.

### September!

Now that I'm home and the major acrobatics are over with, it's all about settling back into a daily and weekly rhythm, trying to figure out how to properly and reasonably apportion my free time so that I can actually complete projects and marshal my small collection of brain cells in the same general direction.

These days I'm reading a book on the history of Irish emigration to America, my friend Taalumot's guide to space weather, my other friend Lee's gender zine, and a rotating subcast of poetry books. The soundscape is exclusively Hozier's newest album, Unreal Unearth, on repeat since the moment it came out. I'm doing my yogas in the morning, a fifteen-minute sun salutation routine with some other hip-opening stretches just to get the blood moving.

There's someone local who I've seen a couple times, and I'd like to say we're seeing each other, but you never know how these things might fizzle out sometimes, and I don't want to put too much weight on it anyways. Either way, it's nice when I see him and I'm trying to practice radical patience by not divining the entire trajectory of the relationship based on the past two or three days on a rolling basis. Especially as we get older we all have Lives and things will take days and weeks where in school you could see people every day and things moved more quickly.

My snake witch knows that I have Venus in Scorpio and has been sending me memes from that new Doja Cat video with the demon, all labeled things like "pov: a scorpio venus starts flirting with you" and I have never felt so directly called out. Hug a Scorpio Venus in your life today!
