May went a little harder than I expected it to, in the end. The first half was calm enough, finishing out the final shows at the theatre kept me busy enough, then I had a week to not do much at all before I was supposed to go to another Burn, this time in Virginia. Instead, Grandy fell on Sunday (the 21st) and has been in the hospital ever since. We've moved her to hospice now, and it has become a waiting game. I spend most days here with her, primarily so if she wakes up she isn't alone, at least some of the time. I had taken the whole week off for my trip, so I was very available to stay by her side. I've had to go back to work now, but it's light and they're very understanding.

She was less conscious, today she's moreso, but since she can't really talk it's harder on me when she is awake. She had talked repeatedly about wanting to just "go on morphine and die", like her sister Dottie had done many years ago. I think she thought she'd just go to sleep and never wake up, but every time she wakes up she's not happy about it. I think. I might be projecting, but I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to be here any more, her body just isn't ready to let go. So we wait.

One reaction I'm having to this slow-moving.. not *crisis*, exactly, but steady Call To Responsibility is that the veil is thin between me and all of my other tucked-away neuroses. I've begun to hyperfixate and pine over my ex, whom I'm now in contact with again. I see him at the group social gatherings and it's really shaken loose all of this emotional turmoil left over from high school when we exploded rather spectacularly in front of the entire group (a few of whom are still part of The Group today) and I left in disgrace.

As I told him when I first got back and we started talking: I'm not better, I'm just better contained, but that containment has been consistently weak for a while now and it makes it hard to just be a normal person, which is what you're supposed to do when you feel like an alien.

June will be busy with the final show of the season, we'll see what fun rebounds my mental health goes through once I am released from the tension of the current moment.
