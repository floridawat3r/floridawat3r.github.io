## April Retrospective & May Afternoon

April has been a month of warm nights, hot days, a week of rain at one point, and otherwise a settling-in feeling has come over me. I've been in Florida long enough now (seven and a half months) that I feel like I understand the boundaries of my living situation, I know the places I'm going to go and I know how long it takes me to get there. After a few shakeups and unusual activities in March, I find that April has been about getting back to my routine before the next round of activities begins.

My weekends are spent at the box office of our little community theatre, selling tickets and answering questions, after which I go across the bridge to one of a few seedy little bars that I like, to see a few folks who are otherwise too busy to hang out the rest of the week.

Saturdays are the busiest, biking south (4.5 miles) to grandy's, then north (15.5 miles) to work, then further south (17.5 miles) past grandy to friends' drinks, then back home (6.5 miles), all along one stretch of a river-near stroad.

Leading up to the eclipse, I experienced my first same-sex liaison, after which I experienced fairly immediate Medical Consequences, also for the first time. All the necessary measures have been taken and parties notified, but boy howdy that really wasn't quite how I was hoping such an encounter would go.

On the day of the eclipse, I received word that my bio-dad had passed away, so that was also new and unique for me. There will at some point be a memorial or something in Raleigh, so that is something to keep the calendar open for.

Right now I'm standing in the shade of a giant oak tree with my bike. We're waiting until a little after time to show up to this party for work.

Standing in the breeze of the afternoon, going back and back in my mind to the last time I had a journal like this. I was bullied via LiveJournal back when that was the thing and so being open about my life is difficult.

Real 12H Mercury vibes-- I've often gotten in trouble with the people in my life for talking about the parts that contain them.
