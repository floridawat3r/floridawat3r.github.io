(Note: when I first wrote this post, I had not experienced substackâ€™s Notes feature. It is alarmingly birdsite-esque and I fear its hold on me)

Who am I and why am I writing? A good a place to start as any, but I'll answer them in reverse.

I'm writing now because it's what everyone else in my circle is doing. Twitter is fracturing and like Nathan Drake trying to outrun the crumbling cliff, I'm trying to keep up with the people I want to be near. TPoT has split pretty cleanly between Mastodon and Bluesky-- Mastodon being the "that's enough of this kind of thing" contingent and Bluesky being the "more of this exact thing, refined, directly into my veins" contingent.

I've been quietly begging Twitter to die for months now. I'm so ready to have my time back, as I don't have the strength of character to put the damn thing down. Mastodon has more friction and is self-consciously Not Like Twitter in ways that I'm finding I really value. The person I am on Twitter is not someone I want to be any more. 

Mastodon is a move back toward long-form, independent blogs. Substacks and personal web pages are reappearing, and I want to continue to be a part of the group, so I have to write. The low-effort, steady presence of likes and shitposts that I could maintain on Twitter is harder to do in the structure of a Blogger. LiveJournal was closer to the kind of environment that I could manage, but I think that sways further into Consolidated Social Media than most people want.

I have to be careful not to let the perfectionism choke me up the way it used to. I have to be willing to put out posts that aren't sensical or well-organized sometimes. The image of myself as perfect is too appealing.

So this is my signal out into the world. A radio-wave pulse broadcast to any dish curved enough to listen. _I'm here. Can you hear me?_
