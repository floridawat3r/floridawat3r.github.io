Inpsiration comes thick and fast when it does come. I should be *editing* a poem (this is more exciting than "I should be writing a poem") but of course I finally had some ideas gel that necessitated a blog post. Please form an orderly queue!

# Spiritual Materials

The other day I was lucky enough to sit with [Joli](https://linktr.ee/bodhimindful) (aka Bodhi Mindful), an astrologer who does 12th part readings of natal charts. I had never heard of the practice before, but the shortest, glossiest version is that the signs are divided up into 2.5-degree chunks representing the other signs, so by looking at those you get a secondary picture of what's going on in your chart. Joli talked about it like the explicit versus implicit themes and narrative of the life. She also talked about the Sun, Moon, and Rising as the Protagonist, Setting, and Narrative Direction? That also piqued my interest and will need to receive further rumination.

## Spiritual Cosplay

The hardest part for me about "getting in to spirituality" has been overcoming the material/spiritual divide, the idea that normal, everyday reality is mundane and lesser-than the shiny, sparkly, light-filled Spiritual World. For a long time, I experienced paganism (my umbrella term for "not monotheistic religious exploration", please don't expect exactitude of a poet) as something two steps removed from LARPing, which is both unfair and also fundamentally true when you think about the relationship between ritual, theatre, energy transfer, etc. Without a community locally to rely on for support in this willful, semi-winking attempt at an alternate reality, I rely instead on Fancy Objects: nice things that seemed set apart from the every day, that aesthetically speak to a time that I've never actually seen or experienced. Spirituality as escapism, as building a little fantasy world to operate in.

I really struggled to make this work though-- the material world seemed to intrude too strongly, too obviously. It was like doing theater with all the house lights on. With other people around, it's easier to slide into their worlds and play along, let myself be carried away however briefly by the force of their belief.

Too often any attempts to build my little worlds are abandoned after a few days, weeks, or months. Very little survives from one attempt to the next. (Weirdly, this is also how I play my minecraft-style video games.) Life takes over and remains completely unaffected by whatever I've done and it eventually falls apart.

## Material Considerations

All of the pictures I have internally of the "spiritual person" are isolated figures, people who have to pull away from the world for one reason or another. I know there are other models out there, but I haven't internalized those yet. I was isolated for a long time and I truly couldn't stand it, so whoever I'm becoming has to be someone who can be in the world-- anything less and I'll just walk into the sea.

This is where Joli comes in. I've gotten her notes from the reading and the recording, but I haven't reviewed them, so this is just what's been percolating since we sat down together. The basic idea is that my spiritual beliefs are the things I live every day, the things I think are so important that I can't imagine thinking it's okay to do otherwise. Examples include biking over driving, gleaning what you need from the secondhand wealth of the world, things like this.

As I was writing about this, I realized that the spiritual bit is the bit underneath-- the idea that learning to live lighter on the earth *and then actually doing that* should be of paramount importance, the idea that we should take life and our impacts more seriously, that Scorpionic intensity, I think that's the spiritual thing about it.

## What's it for?

The other piece I took away from our conversation was that the most useful thing I can do is be visible, be radicalizing, be the thing that reminds other people that there's still work to be done, forces them to look at and consider their own motives and rationalizations. All of this, of course, said with the hope that someone else would do the same for me in turn.

I lost the thread about two-thirds of the way through this as my brain got ahead of my hands, but this was useful for me, hopefully it was at least interesting for you! More to come after I've looked over the notes and re-watched the conversation.
