I've been playing a lot of Valheim recently. It's my favorite style of game-- open world, collect berries, build house. Essentially a Manifest Destiny simulator, minus the guilt. Something I've noticed, though, is that I struggle to enjoy the exploration aspect of the game. It's fun finding ruins and dungeons, etc, but they have no relationship to each other. The world is so completely *terra nullia* that there is no "better" place to set oneself up. Other players will argue about proximity to certain biomes for resources or whatever, but without the context of other relationships, none of it is very exciting. I can build roads, but they will only go to other places I have built. No one but me uses them, and one might argue that this would be solved with a multiplayer server, and I agree, but those are hard to get and keep going, so I tend to play solo.

This is the fundamental flaw with solo open-world games: there's no one else here. That's their biggest selling point too, so you see the conundrum. I don't think there's a style of gameplay that solves this. The problem is upstream-- I crave community and something meaningful to work on. In lieu of these things, I will build a series of small longhouses around a featureless, identity-less world that will likely be deleted one day when I've been away from the game for several months.
